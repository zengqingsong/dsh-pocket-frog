## What is this

**You want to use DeepSeek Harness on your computer, even when you're not at the computer.**

- On your way home, the agent is running a task on your computer — pull out your phone and see where it is, what it produced.
- Out and about, you want the agent on your computer to look something up or write a snippet — no remote desktop, no SSH.
- The computer is at home or in the office, you're elsewhere, and you want to **drive your DeepSeek Harness from your phone** — send tasks, watch the output, tap approvals.

That's what DSH Pocket does: **install it, scan a QR code, and your phone shows and controls the DeepSeek Harness UI in real time — from anywhere.**

What it looks like — the phone shows the exact same UI as your computer, live:

## ✨ Features

| Feature                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📶 LAN QR access             | Works out of the box: Settings → Phone access — scan the LAN QR on the same Wi-Fi (auto-detects the LAN IP; **under WSL it picks the Windows host's physical NIC IP**)                                                                                                            |
| 🚪 LAN switch                | **Turn LAN access off/on with one click** in Settings (a confirmation dialog shows each time): off kills the LAN QR code and link instantly; public access is unaffected                                                                                                          |
| 🌐 Public QR (from anywhere) | Click "Enable anywhere" → cloudflared tunnel → scan the public QR over 4G / any network                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 🏷️ Fixed public hostname     | Optional "**Named tunnel**" mode: paste a Cloudflare Tunnel Token + your own domain — the public address stays **fixed across restarts** (see below)                                                                                                                              |
| 🔐 Access PIN                | Public links use an **8-digit random PIN** by default (rotated on every tunnel start; **customizable to a fixed PIN** — custom PINs are not rotated); LAN has its own separate **8-digit random PIN** (on by default; switchable off in Settings — then LAN scans connect directly) |
| 🔑 Custom PINs               | Both the public and LAN PINs can be **set to a fixed 8–64-character PIN using letters and digits in Settings** (custom PINs are never auto-rotated)                                                                                                                               |
| 🧘 Session persistence       | Enter the PIN once and you're set for a long time (login is tied to the computer's dsh web process: as long as it stays up, the phone won't ask again; **after a dsh web restart/update, enter it once more**)                                                                    |
| ⚡ Real-time sync            | Streaming output passes through WebSocket untouched — what the computer renders, the phone renders live; fully interactive both ways; built-in WS heartbeat keep-alive (defeats silent NAT/battery link drops with auto-reconnect)                                                |
| 📱 Mobile-adaptive layout    | Narrow screens get a drawer layout automatically (ported from dsh-web-mobile, MIT): sidebar drawer, full-width conversation, safe-area insets, touch optimizations                                                                                                                |
| 🧭 Optional right sidebar    | Shows the native right-sidebar entry on mobile; disable it for a compact phone header or keep it available alongside the terminal dock on an unfolded display                                                                                                                     |
| 📁 File browser              | The mobile "Files" entries need a host-side explorer panel (a dsh-web-ui component); on stock DSH without it the entries are auto-hidden instead of doing nothing                                                                                                                 |
| 🗜️ Transfer compression      | Large JSON responses are gzip/brotli'd on the fly (17MB session history → ~1MB; brotli quality 6: fast and bandwidth-friendly) — faster loads, less mobile data                                                                                                                   |
| 🔁 Tunnel auto-restore       | After a DSH restart the previously-running public tunnel comes back automatically                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 🧩 Zero-dependency install   | One npm package, one settings tab — no core/adapter split, no account, no server                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## 🚀 Usage

**Where the entry is**: after installing and restarting `dsh web`, open **Settings** — the left sidebar shows **"Phone access"** at the top level (same level as General / Models):

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/entry.jpg" alt="Phone access entry" width="70%">
</p>

**Prerequisite**: [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) installed. If your terminal says `dsh: command not found`, install it first:

```sh
npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh     # global install; verify: dsh --version
# No global install? Prefix every command with: npx @deepseek-ai/dsh
```

```sh
# 1. Install the plugin (everything in one package)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-pocket-frog -w

# 2. Restart dsh web
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

### LAN (same Wi-Fi)

Settings → **Phone access** → scan the "📶 LAN" QR code → enter the **LAN PIN** (shown in the LAN block; hit **Refresh** to roll a new one, or **Customize** to set an 8–64-character alphanumeric PIN) → the phone opens the exact same DSH, in real time.

> The "**LAN access**" switch is **on by default** and can be **turned off/on with one click** (a confirmation dialog shows each time). Off kills the LAN QR code and link instantly (phones can't open them); **public access is unaffected**. Tap "On" to restore it.
>
> The LAN PIN is **on by default** (security-first). If you're the only user and find typing it every time annoying, flip "LAN access PIN" to **Off** in the LAN block — LAN scans then connect directly with no PIN (LAN-only devices; the **public tunnel always requires a PIN**, unaffected).
>
> After logging in once, the phone **won't ask again**: as long as the computer's dsh web keeps running, reopening the phone needs no PIN (**a dsh web restart/update asks for it once more**).
>
> Advanced option: auto-detection may not pick a reachable address for Tailscale/VPN setups. You can select a detected IP from the "LAN address" dropdown; normally no change is needed.

### Public (from anywhere)

On the same page click "**Enable anywhere**" → **a security disclaimer pops up every time — check "I understand and agree" to proceed** (on a corporate/classified network, confirm compliance first) → wait for the tunnel (first run downloads cloudflared; macOS/Linux use the Tsinghua mirror, seconds) → scan the "🌐 Public" QR code → the phone opens the link and **enters the access PIN** (shown in the settings page's public section; the default is an **8-digit random PIN rotated on every tunnel start**, or use **Customize** for a fixed 8–64-character alphanumeric PIN that is never rotated) → works from outside (4G / office network).

> Upgrading: `dsh plugin --profile web update dsh-pocket-frog --latest -w` (`--latest` is required across major versions — a `^0.x` range won't auto-jump to 1.x).

### Fixed public hostname (named tunnel, optional)

The default "quick tunnel" gets a new random URL on every restart. For a **fixed public address**, use a Cloudflare **named tunnel** (requires a Cloudflare account + your own domain):

1. In [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) → **Networks → Tunnels**, create a Tunnel and copy the **Tunnel Token**
2. In that Tunnel's **Public Hostname**, point your domain (e.g. `pocket.example.com`) to `http://127.0.0.1:3081`
3. Back in the settings page's public section: switch the mode to "**Named tunnel**", paste the Tunnel Token, enter the fixed hostname, and save
4. Click "Enable anywhere" → the public address is now your own hostname and **survives restarts**

Note: in named-tunnel mode the public PIN is **not auto-rotated** (the address is fixed, so the PIN stays the same across restarts) — manage it proactively with a custom PIN. The Tunnel Token is stored locally only (`$DSH_HOME/dsh-pocket-frog/settings.json`, readable by your user only) and is never echoed back in the UI.

## ⚠️ Security (read first)

- **DSH can execute code on your computer.** **LAN** QR/URL plus its own **8-character PIN** is the key (PIN **on by default**, switchable off — then LAN scans connect directly, same-network devices only) — **never share the LAN QR, URL or PIN**.
- **Read and accept the security disclaimer before enabling public access** (the dialog shows on every enable; the server enforces it, so it can't be bypassed): public = exposing a code-executing DSH to the internet — use a strong PIN, turn it off when done, never on classified networks.
- **Public** access uses an **8-digit random PIN** by default: the link is random, the PIN rotates on every tunnel start, and old links die instantly — even a leaked link can't get in. **A custom PIN may contain 8–64 letters and digits and is never auto-rotated**.
- Phone login state is tied to the computer's dsh web process: **no re-entry while dsh web stays up; one re-entry after a restart/update**.
- **Login rate limiting** (anti brute-force): **5** consecutive wrong PINs from the same IP lock it for **60s**; a global failure threshold briefly locks everyone (blocks distributed IP-rotation scans); a successful login resets the counter.
- The public URL is randomly assigned by cloudflared and **changes on every restart** (old links die automatically — a natural key rotation); in **named-tunnel fixed-hostname** mode the address stays and the PIN is not auto-rotated — manage it with a custom PIN.
- **Public detection is fail-closed** (issue #66): everything except loopback and private LAN addresses is treated as **public and PIN-gated** — including any self-hosted tunnel / reverse proxy pointing at the local port with its own hostname. There is no "change the domain to bypass the PIN" hole.
- LAN mode exposes nothing publicly; only devices on the same network can reach it.
- Built for personal use; the public PIN lives in `$DSH_HOME/dsh-pocket-frog/token` (re-rolled per tunnel start unless customized), the LAN PIN in `$DSH_HOME/dsh-pocket-frog/token-lan` (refreshed manually in Settings), and switches/custom flags in `$DSH_HOME/dsh-pocket-frog/settings.json`.

## 💻 DSH Desktop

- In the desktop app, **QR screen-mirroring works**; **update/restart are managed by the desktop app** (auto-disabled here).
- ⚠️ The desktop **advanced mode** doesn't support phone access yet (it disables the web layout; the phone gets no layout service → blank screen). Switch back to **compatibility** mode and restart; phones opening an advanced-mode page will see a clear notice overlay.

## ⚠️ Public tunnel troubleshooting (read first)

**Symptom**: after clicking "Enable anywhere", the public URL shows `error 1033` (Tunnel error) on the phone.

**Most common cause: a local proxy/VPN (Clash, Surge, v2ray, sing-box, etc., especially in TUN mode).**
Such tools take over all traffic and often cut cloudflared's tunnel-edge connections
(`*.argotunnel.com`, Cloudflare edge IPs), so the tunnel registers but the data plane never connects.

**Fix (try in order, lightest first)**:

1. First **just turn off the proxy's TUN mode** — no need to quit the proxy; this is enough in most cases:
   - Clash: turn off the "**TUN mode**" toggle in Settings (or right-click the menu-bar icon → uncheck TUN mode)
   - Surge: turn off "**Enhanced mode**"; v2ray/sing-box: turn off "**virtual NIC / route takeover**"
   - Then go back to the settings page and click "Enable anywhere" again
2. If that's not enough, temporarily **fully quit the proxy** (not just close the window: quit Clash from the menu-bar icon; if a
   background service is installed, stop it in the service manager and confirm with `ps aux | grep clash`), then retry.
3. Add **DIRECT rules** to the proxy for the tunnel domains and Cloudflare edge (Clash example):
   ```yaml
   - DOMAIN-SUFFIX,argotunnel.com,DIRECT
   - DOMAIN-SUFFIX,trycloudflare.com,DIRECT
   - IP-CIDR,198.41.192.0/24,DIRECT,no-resolve
   ```
4. If the network really can't reach the tunnel, use **LAN mode**: turn on the phone hotspot → connect the computer to it → scan the LAN QR. Same experience, from anywhere.

**Other causes**: corporate firewalls / campus networks blocking outbound — ask IT to allow it, or use a hotspot.

**First run: "Downloading cloudflared" fails or hangs**:

- **macOS/Linux**: the plugin first downloads from the **Tsinghua mirror** (measured ~3MB/s, done in seconds); falls back to official GitHub + acceleration mirrors if it fails.
- **Windows**: no Tsinghua mirror (Homebrew doesn't support Windows) — downloads the ~50MB exe from GitHub directly; **single-threaded, so it's slower — that's expected**, wait a few minutes, or use a proxy.
- If all sources fail, the settings page shows a hint. Alternatives (any one):

1. Install the `cloudflared` command and retry (the plugin then uses the PATH binary, no download):
   - macOS: `brew install cloudflared`; Linux: `sudo apt install cloudflared` or from the official site
   - Windows: `winget install cloudflared` or from the official site
   - Any platform: `npm i -g cloudflared`
2. Enable a proxy (system proxy / Clash etc.) and click "Enable anywhere" again
3. Manually download the binary into `$DSH_HOME/dsh-pocket-frog/bin/` (`$DSH_HOME` is usually `~/.dsh`, on Windows `%USERPROFILE%\.dsh`; name it `cloudflared` (add `.exe` on Windows) **or** the release asset name — both are recognized)
